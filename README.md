# Disaster Tweet Classification
This project focuses on classifying tweets as disaster or non-disaster using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). It involves data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and deployment of a web interface for real-time classification.

# Project Overview
The dataset used consists of 10,000 tweets labeled as disaster or non-disaster. The goal is to build a robust model that accurately classifies tweets, enabling quick identification of disaster-related content.

# Project Steps
## Data Exploration and Preparation

* Explore the structure of the dataset to understand the columns and data types.
* Visualize the distribution of disaster vs. non-disaster tweets.
* Analyze common keywords and phrases associated with disaster tweets.
* Clean text data by removing special characters, URLs, and punctuation.
* Tokenize text and convert labels into numerical format.
* Split data into training and testing sets.

## Feature Engineering and Model Selection

* Extract features such as word frequencies, TF-IDF scores, and sentiment analysis.
* Consider additional features like tweet length and the presence of hashtags or mentions.
* Train and evaluate candidate models, including logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks, using cross-validation.
* Optimize model hyperparameters through grid or random search.

## Model Evaluation and Validation

* Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other binary classification metrics.
* Visualize performance with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.
* Validate the model on a testing dataset to ensure robustness and check for overfitting.

## Deployment with Web Interface

* Serialize the trained model into a pickle file.
* Develop a user-friendly web application (using Streamlit or Flask) for input and classification results.
* Deploy the application to a platform like streamlit and flask.
